	 The newest Limited Edition Birkin is this fabulous little Birkin 25 called the “In and Out”.  It features some of the things you might carry inside your Birkin – your change purse, a lipstick, and a pencil, as well as a Rodeo charm and the little bag for your key & lock.   It has the usual orange Hermes 25cm Birkin box but inside it has a sloped navy blue shelf for the bag, so it is never lying flat.  Very smart.   The dustbags have also been changed to be highlighted in navy blue rather than the usual dark brown.   All in all, a very special bag!

	 The 2002 is Hermes’ newest shoulder bag and was first seen towards the end of 2017 – according to some the ‘futuristic’ design was apparently originally from back in the early 1970’s and was named as at that time 2002 seemed the distant future.  It has interior and exterior pockets which make it easy to use and a zipped internal pocket.  The unusual H clasp opens by lifting the middle part of the H, and then sliding out the tab.  The strap has three lengths which enables the bag to be worn cross body or over the shoulder.  Full measurements are 26cm x 23cm x 7cm (approximately). 
 This particular bag is in a very striking combination of Black & White  Swift leather , with a central piece in  Grey Canvas  and with  Palladium Hardware .
