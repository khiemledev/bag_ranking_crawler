"pre-owned pleated cape detail dress
Hermès are famous for the highest quality items produced almost entirely in their French ateliers. The maison is a benchmark for luxury and creates pieces that stand the test of time and remain stylish era-to-era. This evening gown was fashioned in Hermès' birth country, displaying all its splendour and elegance. Crafted from the purest silk in a delicate turquoise blue tone, it is the perfect call for a luxury event. This piece features a cape detail, which is a continuation of a scarf-like detail around the deep V-neck. Draped all over, its silhouette displays an empire line with no sleeves. The fastening is concealed on the back, to a long length of an asymmetric opulent skirt. Please be mindful that this piece has led a previous life, and may tell its story through minor imperfection. Purchasing this item continues its narrative, so you can be confident that you’re making a POSITIVELY CONSCIOUS choice for the planet.

pre-owned Kelly picnic bag
Named after Grace Kelly, late Princess of Monaco, the Kelly bag has a particular story behind it. Believed to be an accessory used to disguise the Princess’ pregnancy belly, the public started to refer to it using her name. Within a short span of time, the bag was baptised by the masses as The Kelly Bag, and soon Hermès adopted the catchy name. Crafted in France from beige and brown straw and leather, the Kelly picnic tote features a leather trim, top handles, a front flap closure, a padlock fastening detail, a hanging key fob and purse feet.
